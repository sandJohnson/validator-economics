# Validator Economics: Variable minimum validator deposit size
## Project Abstract
To help facilitate the feasibility of single slot finality (SSF) we need to address the challenge of a potentially unbounded number of validators operating on the Ethereum beacon chain.

## Background
Vitalik proposed several strategies for capping the validator set, and in the [blog post](https://notes.ethereum.org/@vbuterin/single_slot_finality) discusses the pros and cons of each of the strategies.
This project focuses on one of the proposed strategies, *variable minimum validator balance*, to achieve four key objectives:

- In-depth knowledge of the potential impacts on the wider ecosystem
- Identification of risks and attack scenarios
- Identification of potential mitigations of risks resulting in a potentially slightly altered proposal
- Recommendation of the suitability of the proposed strategy

## Milestones and Deliverables

| Milestone | Deliverable |
|-------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Identify relevant data insights that will provide a deeper understanding of the current situation and any intuitions or assumptions  used in formulating proposed solutions | Document detailing required data, data sources and visualisations|
| Data gathering / wrangling | Document describing progress, procedures and visualisations |
| Exploratory data analysis and visualisation | Publish the data analysis and visualisation code in GitHub |
| Detailed breakdown of the variable minimum validator balance proposal | Identification of variables, impacts and possible knock-on effects resulting from the introduction of this strategy. Write up as paper or blog post for community input and comments |
| Statistical / mathematical model of the variable minimum balance strategy | Statistical model published in a conference or journal paper to describe progress to date |
|Identify risks, edge cases and attack scenarios | Use model to explore extreme scenarios and document outcomes |
| Identify any major and minor issues with the proposal and variations on the initial proposal that could mitigate or eliminate those problems | Write project up as a journal article, and / or conference paper |
